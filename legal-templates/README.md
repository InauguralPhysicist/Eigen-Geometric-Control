# Legal Templates

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are templates only. Consult with an attorney before using any legal documents.**

## What's Here

### COMMERCIAL-LICENSE-AGREEMENT.md
Fill-in-the-blank template for commercial license agreements.

**Use this when:**
- A company wants to use Eigen in a commercial product
- You're negotiating a paid license
- You need a formal agreement beyond email

**How to use:**
1. Copy the template to a new file (e.g., `License-CompanyName-2025-01-15.md`)
2. Fill in all bracketed fields: `[Company Name]`, `[Amount]`, etc.
3. Check the appropriate boxes for license type and scope
4. **Have an attorney review before sending**
5. Use DocuSign, HelloSign, or similar for digital signatures
6. Keep signed copy in secure location

## Suggested Pricing

**Based on company size and use case:**

| Company Size | Perpetual License | Annual License |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Startup (<50) | $2,500 - $10,000 | $500 - $2,000 |
| Mid-size (50-500) | $10,000 - $50,000 | $2,000 - $10,000 |
| Enterprise (500+) | $50,000+ | $10,000+ |

**Revenue share model:**
- 2-5% of product revenue for products primarily built on Eigen
- Useful for startups with limited capital
- Requires audit rights in agreement

## Negotiation Tips

**Factors to consider:**
- Company revenue and valuation
- Strategic value (will they promote your work?)
- Number of developers using the framework
- Geographic scope (worldwide vs specific regions)
- Industry (aerospace/robotics commands premium)
- Support obligations (more support = higher fee)

**Deal structures:**
- **Perpetual:** One-time payment, indefinite use (common for established companies)
- **Annual:** Recurring revenue, includes updates (good for ongoing relationship)
- **Revenue share:** Lower upfront, percentage of sales (startup-friendly)
- **Hybrid:** Small upfront + smaller revenue share

## When Someone Asks for a Commercial License

Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest in using Eigen Geometric Control commercially.
I'd be happy to discuss a commercial license for [Company].

To provide an appropriate quote, could you share:

3. Number of developers who will work with the framework
4. Expected deployment scope (users, servers, geographic regions)
5. Timeline for implementation

I offer several license types:
- Perpetual licenses (one-time fee)
- Annual subscriptions (includes support and updates)

Let's schedule a brief call to discuss your needs.

Best,
